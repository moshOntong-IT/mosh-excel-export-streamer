## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- üéØ **Data Mapper Feature**: Optional callback parameter for `streamFromQuery()` enabling row-by-row data transformations
- Memory-efficient complex calculations during streaming without loading full datasets into memory
- Error handling with automatic fallback to default column extraction when mapper fails
- Comprehensive data mapper examples in test application with 6 real-world scenarios:
  - Financial reports with revenue/profit calculations
  - Customer summaries with aggregated order statistics
  - Product performance metrics with sales data
  - Error handling demonstrations
  - Complex nested data transformations
  - User activity reports with behavioral analytics
- Interactive data mapper examples page (`/data-mapper-examples`) with live code snippets
- Navigation integration for easy access to data mapper features

### Improved
- üìñ **Documentation accuracy**: Updated README with honest descriptions of streaming vs file generation approaches
- Added "How It Works" section clearly explaining CSV (true streaming) vs XLSX (generate + stream) behavior differences
- Enhanced performance tips with format-specific optimization guidance
- Comprehensive data mapper usage examples with real-world code snippets
- Updated feature descriptions to reflect actual capabilities rather than marketing claims
- Test application homepage with prominent data mapper showcase section

### Fixed
- üêõ **XLSX file corruption**: Resolved "Excel cannot open file" errors by implementing proper ZIP structure
- **Streaming performance**: Fixed degradation issues for single-sheet XLSX exports
- **ZIP structure problems**: Corrected malformed ZIP archives that browsers rejected with connection errors
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized complex data transformations to maintain streaming performance

### Technical Details
- Enhanced `ChunkedQueryProcessor` with `$dataMapper` parameter support
- Added error logging for mapper failures with contextual information
- Improved XLSX generation using MultiSheetExporter for proper ZIP compliance
- Maintained backward compatibility - existing code continues working unchanged
